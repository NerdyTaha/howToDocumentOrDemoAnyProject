# A guide on how to document and demo a project. 
(Disclaimer: This is solely based on my experience and intuition)
---
- While building end-to-end projects, either solo or with a team, good docs help you and your team. Even git commits should be well written.
- So, as a solo dev, wrapping your mind across the entire project can get hard (coz ur context window is small twin..lol)
- To solve this, I make 4 markdown files -- which is not something new because people have been using it but here is how I design a consitent documentation sytem which helps me as an engineer building stuff end to end:
- readme.md, code_docs.md, changelog.md, dev_logs.md : these are the 4 files to make. 

## readme.md 

## code_docs.md 

## changelog.md

## dev_logs.md
